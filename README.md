Node Express and JavaScript website for CSC 3221

This website was built while learning Node Express and Javascript. I have kept this repo because the Hangman page is a good example of my experience with frontend Javascript.

This page is currently hosted on Heroku: [HANGMAN!](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pacific-hollows-77413.herokuapp.com/Hangman/hangman.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1635816271032000&usg=AOvVaw1DLAkGFxzypNzQrwRa3qhl)
