                Everybody is special. Everybody. Everybody is a hero, a lover, a fool, a villain, everybody. Everybody

        <h2>Blade Runner</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched
                C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears
                in rain.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                We can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist. Humans fancy that there's something
                special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops as tight and as closed as the hosts do,
                seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next.

        <h2>The Matrix</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I'm going to be honest with you. I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call
                it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your
                stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it. It's -- it's repulsive! Isn't it? I must
                get out of here. I must get free... and in this mind is the key, my key. Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need
                for me to be here. Do you understand? I need the codes, I have to get inside Zion and you have to tell me how. You're
                going to tell me, or you're going to die!
