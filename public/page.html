<h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
<h2>My name is: Gregory Isaac Maynard</h2>
<h3>The day I had the most fun</h3>
<p>
    The year was 27 ABY and the other clones and I had finished fighting in the Battle of Tirahnn.
    I lost many friends in the fighting.  I especially miss Delta-192 whom I had become close to.
    We grew up in the clone factory in kamino together.  Because the fighting was so hard, I think
    supervisor Bob felt sorry for us.  Bob decided to throw us all our first birthday party.  We were
    allowed to share a cake and they told us what a good job we were doing.  It was the <strong>best</strong> day of
    my life.
